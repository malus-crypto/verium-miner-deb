# Verium Miner Debian (Ubuntu) package

A basic package containing @fireworm71's miner (https://github.com/fireworm71/veriumMiner) and systemd unit files to run it as a service.


**Build both versions and test at install time for the correct one**
Better yet, test at run time and run the correct one!

## Publish package
```bash
reprepro -b ../mining-repo/ubuntu/ includedeb bionic pkg.deb
```

```bash
reprepro -b ../mining-repo/ubuntu/ list bionic
```

## Notes

@linquize @ekovacs I ran into this when cross-building ARM binaries in a container via qemu using a build system that checks `/proc/cpuinfo` for architecture (yeah...)

In principle, you can just overwrite /proc/stuff by bind-mounting your replacement file.

On the host:

Run container in privileged mode: `docker run --privileged ...`
In the container:

file cpuinfo.raspi3 exists, was generated by cat /proc/cpuinfo on an actual device + committed to repo
```bash
sudo mount --bind ./cpuinfo.raspi3 /proc/cpuinfo at runtime
```

### Restart?
